# KuaiLive

*KuaiLive* is a large-scale real-world dataset for live streaming recommendation collected from [Kuaishou](https://www.kuaishou.com/en), a leading live streaming platform in China with over 400 million daily active users. Notably, revenue from live streaming contributes approximately 30% of the companyâ€™s total income, highlighting its significant commercial potential.

**This is the first publicly available live streaming dataset that captures rich and realistic sequences of user interactions within an interactive app environment.**
